DAT 505 Project - Shows my working VR space. Next step is to create a button that will search for VR devices. Code also needs to be commented and more sophisticated. 

3D City - Shows my basic city design worked into code. Next step is to decide on the camera angle, possibly do a birds eye view, or from the front. 

MAYA City - Shows my basic city so far. I need to create different Textures for the buildings and play with colour and light to make the city look more visually appealing.

Inspiration Idea - Shows my thoughts on how the city may turn out to be?

Once I have the VR button and a better City design I will intergrate them and then use add audio that the visuals will react to. For example the colour of the windows could change depending on the beat of the music.
I know that my project needs a lot of work and it is no where near finished!
